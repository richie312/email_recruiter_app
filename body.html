        My name is Aritra Chatterjee. I have almost close to 6 years of experience in 
        the field of Data Science and IT Development and Operatiions in the domain 
        like Optmisation Modelling,Statistical Modelling, Simulation Modelling, 
        Visualisation,Deep Learning(Computer Vision),Natural Language Processing. 
        The majority of work experience is in Data Wrangling ,visualisation, 
        application development and cloud deployment and end to end automation. 
        25% of my work is in Modelling(statistical and optimisation).
        I also have experience in IT operation (Serivce Management Analytics,ITIL) 
        which majorly involves visualisation,application development(Shiny Dashboard_R).

        I am also involved in Robotics. I have hands on experience in making robots 
        with Raspberry pi. I have made a car and it is deployed with cam module, 
        temperature sensor (shows temperature) and ultrasonic sensor in order to
        detect the objects. The robot is wirelessly controlled and its visual comes 
        from the cam deployed on the car which also helps in navigation.

        I am also involved in Budhissm studies (Psychsomatic study of practice) and 
        regularly practice vipassana in order to understand the mind and matter 
        phenomenon. I am also in troduced to the teachings of Non Duality and spent 
        significant time in order to understand the teachings.
